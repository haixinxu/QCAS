This archive will help you embedd the giac computer algebra system 
in your QT application.
It contains all the required source files from 
- giac http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac.html
- the long integer library libtommath http://libtom.org/
- a minimal qt interface 

Step 1: extract the archive in a directory 
Step 2: run 
  qtcreator test.pro &
or
  necessitas test.pro &
(if you want to build an Android application with Ministro Qt libs).
Step 3: build and run the minimal interface. Try for example 
a:=int(1/(x^4-1)) enter  then factor(diff(a)) enter
Step 4: modify to suit your needs!

Requirements: the giac+tommath library (without UI) are about 5M of code (ARM),
and require at least 512K of RAM to run.
